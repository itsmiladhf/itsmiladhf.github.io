I turned 26 a couple of months ago. Since then, I've become much more conscious about time.

I think a lot about how I spend my days. I often feel like I'm not doing enough to grow: not learning fast enough, not building enough, not putting myself out there enough. To address this, I've been moving in many directions at once: reading more, diving deeper into computer vision, exploring things outside my field, and trying to network with more people.

A good part of this urgency is fueled by the realization that I'm in the second half of my twenties. There's this window where taking risks feels more acceptable, where the cost of failure is lower, and where the potential upside of bold moves is highest. I don't want to look back and wonder why I played it safe.

But there's another force at play. As someone who consumes a lot of talks, podcasts, and content about AI and technology, I see the pace at which things are changing. It's exhilarating and terrifying at the same time. The tools I use at work today didn't exist two years ago. The things I'm learning now might be obsolete in five. This isn't a complaint. It's motivation. If the world is moving this fast, I need to move with it. Or better, ahead of it.

So why this blog?

I've wanted to start writing for a long time. Not because I think I have all the answers or I am anything close to a good writer, but because writing forces clarity. It makes you organize scattered thoughts into something coherent. And putting it out in public? Scary, but it adds accountability.

This site is my attempt to document the journey: what I'm learning, what I'm building, what I'm thinking about. Some posts will be technical. Some will be reflections like this one. Some might just be me processing an idea out loud.

If you're reading this, thanks for being here. Let's see where this goes.
